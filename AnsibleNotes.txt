Developed by Redhat
Ansible Tower by Redhat is the web based interface for Ansible
Open Source
Cental point which controls other parts
Uses tools such as ssh

=======================

Insalled on Computer(Main Ansible PC) and it communicates with other computers from there
nothing to install on client computer, just python and ssh is needed.
Some stuff can still be done using just ssh
Since it uses so much ssh, plan ssh access username(consistent across clients), sudo(good) or root(bad), passwordless keys or ssh-agent
After installing ansible, quick check:

amrinder@:~$ ansible localhost -m  ping
 [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
amrinder@:~$ 

for SSH: desklabadmin username across all the clients

=========================

Topology:

amrinder-HP-t620-Quad-Core-TC : Ansible Central Point 192.168.160.35
desklab-netscreen: Spoke 1 [Password Bassed Authentication] 192.168.160.1
desklab-fortigate: Spoke 2 [Public Private Key Pair] 192.168.160.10
desklab-centos: Spoke 3 [Public Private Key Pair] 192.168.160.36

Escalate privelege on the clients so that we can use sudo with it asking for the password.

sudo visudo
desklabadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

This will allow desklabadmin to run priveleged commands using sudo but will not ask for the password.
===========================
